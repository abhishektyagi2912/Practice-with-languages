<!-- here i learn two way binding in react js -->

---> Two way binding is a process where we inform react that how data is changed and react will update the data in the DOM and user also see that.

---> Here we use ...maintask it mean we use all the data of maintask and we use it in the input field.
<!-- in simple words maintask when we fetch then we don't want to override the pervious task and show latest that's why we use ...maintask. -->
